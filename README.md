# Sketchpad_Javascript

Purpose :- Implement a sketchpad

Description :- Following project is a browser version of a sketchpad built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery. The HTML is a blank page in which the data is added dynamically by using javascript. The formatting is done using CSS. The main idea is to create multiple square div's inside the main sketpad div and set up a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
